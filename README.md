# 🎄 christmas-2024-tie

Welcome to **christmas-2024-tie** - a festive, ridiculous, and slightly petty electronics project born from an annual tradition of absurdity.

## 🎁 The Backstory

Every year, my cousin and I engage in our favorite Christmas tradition: mutual torment disguised as holiday fun. It involves themes, costumes, and a lot of regrettable public embarrassment. The rules are simple: make the other person wear something so ridiculous they’ll wish they never agreed to this cursed tradition.

For Christmas 2024, the theme was ties, which my cousin foolishly thought would be easy to survive. Alas, when I remembered his passionate hatred for "Shiny" from Moana, I realized I had the chance to create something that would haunt his holidays forever...and maybe mine too.

## 🦀 Introducing: The Christmas Crab Tie

What started as a humble tie ended up as a masterpiece of revenge and holiday cheer. Here's what it does:

- Comes to life when you pull the tie - powered by a trusty pull-cord light switch (yes, the kind from your nan’s bathroom) wired into a 555 timer circuit
- Pulling the tie triggers a quick blast of "Shiny" from Moana, complete with flashing lights for maximum theatrical horror
- The timer limits the chaos to half a minute - which is just long enough to be annoying, and just short enough that people immediately want to pull it again

Because nothing says "holiday spirit" like a crustacean-powered musical trap.

- Bluetooth app to control song choice on the fly
